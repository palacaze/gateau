# Socute CMake Modules

This project consists in a set of CMake modules that make working with CMake both
easier and safer.

It has been designed as a pragmatic tool to quickly create a working cmake
configuration for C++ projects. As such, it is quite opiniated and equiped to
handle the situations I commonly encounter. However, it may not be able to cope
with random project layouts and unusual or complex needs.

This tool is currently being used to build C++ software, mostly on GNU/Linux,
sometimes on MS Windows, using the GCC, Clang and Mingw compilers. Help will be
needed to improve compatibility with other systems and compilers.

## Features

Socute aims to simplify the definition of the CMake configuration for your
project. To paraphrase a famous book title, It does so by automating the boring
stuff, and choosing sane defaults so you don't need to.

It contains a few functions, macros and configuration variables that make it
very simple to create an installable project with external dependencies, a few
targets, unit test and some documentation.

In particular it is capable of:

- Setting up useful options to make c++ development convenient:
  - Sane compiler options,
  - Sanitizers integration,
  - LTO, ccache use...
- Looking for dependencies, downloading and compiling for you if missing,
- Declaring new targets that will be configured in a sensible way for you to
  make it both installable and importable by other projects. An export header
  and version header get generated for every target.
- Making targets trivially installable, with automatic installation of binaries,
  headers as well as generation of CMake config, version and target modules so
  that your project can be found and used by other projects.
- Declaring tests in a simple way,
- Automatically generating Doxygen documentation,
- Generating translation files for Qt based projects.

Again, it is a simple tool, not a full-fledge package manager.

## Requirements

### CMake

Only CMake is needed. Version 3.15 or later is mandatory, as Socute modules
relies on modern CMake constructs to achieve its goals.

### Project organization

The project layout on the file system is not imposed but it is recommended to
organize public headers in the same way you want them installed. That way it will
be possible to automate installation.

A possible layout is the following:

```
Project
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── data/
│  └── Misc.svg
├── doc/
├── example/
│  ├── CMakeLists.txt
│  ├── Example1.cpp
│  └── Example2.cpp
├── README.md
├── src/
│  └── Project/
│     └── Target/
│        ├── CMakeLists.txt
│        ├── File.h
│        ├── File.cpp
│        └── PublicHeader1.h
│        └── PublicHeader2.h
└── test/
   ├── CMakeLists.txt
   ├── Test1.cpp
   └── Test2.cpp
```

This makes it possible to `#include <Project/Target/PublicHeader1.h>` from any
other public header. The singular `test` and `example` directories make it
possible to defined idiomatic `tests` and `examples` CMake targets.


Another customary layout is to put the public headers in the `include` directory:

```
Project
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── include/
│  └── Project/
│     └── Target/
│        ├── CMakeLists.txt
│        └── PublicHeader1.h
│        └── PublicHeader2.h
├── README.md
├── src/
   └── Target/
      ├── CMakeLists.txt
      ├── File.h
      ├── File.cpp
```

Socute can be customized to look for public headers from other base directories,
chances are that you current project layout can be handled easily.

## User Manual

### Configuration and user visible options

Socute generates a number of configuration variables. Some are meant solely
for to describe the project and are thus internal, others can be used to tweak
the build configuration.

Each variable is prefixed with an identifier created from the project name. The
identifier is obtained by separating the words of the project name and producing
a C Identifier equivalent string of it. For instance:

| Project Name | Equivalent Prefix |
|--------------|-------------------|
| myproj       | MYPROJ            |
| my-proj      | MY_PROJ           |
| Myproj       | MYPROJ            |
| MyProj       | MY_PROJ           |
| my_proj      | MY_PROJ           |

This prefix identifier is stored in the `PROJECT_IDENT` cache variable.

Here is a breakdown of the variables generated by Socute, by type
